I am retired now, having been a software developer and systems engineer for longer than I care to remember. I stay busy tinkering with the old and learning the new. 
My interests are music (learning jazz standards on guitar and piano), electronics (learning how to exploit Arduinos), and coding (recreating classic blunders 
in C and so forth - pun intended).

I can be reached at mwduffy@gmail.com.
